Mindustry Sound Music Studio (MS²) is a sound and track creation tool made in and for Mindustry. It should expedite any music creation process (using mindustry sfx via the "play sound" feature of world processors).

Schematic (file) consists mostly of world processor logic and erekir blocks.

Requirements: world processor editing enabled, erekir blocks (not really necessary, but they greatly improve clarity). 

Video guide will be created, once it has all the desired features for simple-ish music creation.
